 Fennel REPL for Neovim
########################

This is an interactive `Fennel`_ REPL plugin for Neovim.  It allows evaluating
arbitrary Fennel expressions in a running process.  The expression is sent to
the application, evaluated, and the result is sent back to Neovim.

.. warning::

   This plugin executes arbitrary code.  Do not start a REPL automatically.  Do
   not run code you do not trust.  There is no sandboxing going on here, what
   you enter will be executed.


Installation and setup
######################

Requires Fennel 1.3.1 or higher running in the application you want to connect
to.

Install this plugin like any other Neovim plugin, then make sure the
`_protocol` Git submodule has been initialised and checkout precisely to the
version of this plugin.  The plugin communicates with the REPL process through
a protocol, and the submodule ships an implementation of said protocol.
Therefore it is important to keep the plugin and protocol implementation
synchronised.

If you were doing it by hand you would do execute these commands:

.. code:: sh

   git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/fennel-repl.nvim.git

To check out the correct version of the submodule:

.. code:: sh

   git submodule update --checkout _protocol

If you are using a package manager please refer to its documentation on how to
manage submodules.

Installation
============

Install it like any other Neovim plugin.  You do not need Fennel installed, but
the application you want to hook up to has to expose some sort of Fennel REPL
over standard IO. If it does not (e.g. LÃ¶ve2D) you have to write code to expose
the REPL yourself.

Setup
=====

Execute `:Fennel args...` (e.g. `Fennel love . --repl`) to start the process
which exposes a Fennel REPL over its standard IO.  This command will change in
the future!  For now the REPL must conform to the protocol, but later it will
be possible to upgrade the REPL.

Auto completion
===============

A source named `fennel-repl` for `nvim-cmp`_ is included for convenience.  This
source will probably become its own plugin in the future, so do not rely on it
being here.


Status of the plugin
####################

The public interface of the plugin will change.  Do not rely on it.

It works as a basic REPL: you send it text and get text back.  It is the same
as the REPL you get when you run `fennel` from the command-line.

These features are absolutely necessary for a fully working REPL:

- [X] Handling of messages sent to the process standard output
- [X] Handling of messages received from the process standard input

There are a lot of niceties to add:

- [X] Interactive stacktrace: click a line and get taken to that location
- [X] Syntax highlighting of user input (piggy-back on Fennel syntax
  highlighting)
- [X] Auto-completion on the REPL
   - [X] Source for nvim-cmp
   - [X] Include documentation for functions
   - [ ] Include the type of the completion item (probably not useful with CMP
     because the type of an object does not map onto an LSP completion type)
- [X] Documentation lookup (e.g. when pressing `K` while on a symbol)
- [X] Evaluate an expression (e.g. by pressing `<A-K>` while on a symbol)
   - [X] Evaluate current symbol
   - [X] Evaluate current selection
   - [X] Include printed output in preview window
   - [X] Handle errors
   - [ ] Support visual block selection (works, but
     `vim.lsp.util.open_floating_preview` seems to be broken in prompt buffers
     with visual block selection)
- [ ] Cycle through history (e.g. up and down arrows); this is actually hard to
  achieve because Neovim does not let me overwrite just the user's input and
  messes up the state of the prompt buffer

The following features are needed for a robust REPL experience:

- [X] Option to upgrade a REPL which does not follow the protocol; I will
  probably have to ship the upgrade function with this plugin
- [X] Transmitting the formatting function to the server; JSON would be a good
  choice because Neovim can decode it, but how do I teach the server JSON?
- [ ] Ability to strip off a prompt received from the server
