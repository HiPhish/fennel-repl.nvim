 Fennel REPL for Neovim
########################

This is an interactive `Fennel`_ REPL plugin for Neovim.  It allows evaluating
arbitrary Fennel expressions in a running process.  The expression is sent to
the application, evaluated, and the result is sent back to Neovim.


Installation and setup
######################

Requires Fennel 1.3.1 or higher.

Installation
============

Install it like any other Neovim plugin.  You do not need Fennel installed, but
the application you want to hook up to has to expose some sort of Fennel REPL
over standard IO. If it does not (e.g. LÃ¶ve2D) you have to write code to expose
the REPL yourself.

Setup
=====


Status of the plugin
####################

The public interface of the plugin will change.  Do not rely on it.

It works as a basic REPL: you send it text and get text back.  It is the same
as the REPL you get when you run `fennel` from the command-line.  There are a
lot of niceties to add though:

- [ ] Interactive stacktrace: click a line and get taken to that location
- [ ] Auto-completion on the REPL
- [ ] Syntax highlighting of user input (no idea how I can do that)
- [ ] Documentation lookup (e.g. when pressing `K` while on a symbol)

The following features are needed for a robust REPL experience:

- [ ] Option to upgrade a REPL which does not follow the protocol; I will
  probably have to ship the upgrade function with this plugin
- [ ] Ability to strip off a prompt received from the server
- [ ] Transmitting the formatting function to the server; JSON would be a good
  choice because Neovim can decode it, but how do I teach the server JSON?
